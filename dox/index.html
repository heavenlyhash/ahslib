	The <span class=ahsname>AHS</span> library has three primary goals: remove common drudgery from coding in java wherever possible, make writing multithreaded applications easier, and codify common design patterns so that good code becomes more self-documenting.
</p>
<p>
	The <span class=ahsname>AHS</span> library is free and open source, currently licensed under cc:by-nc-nd-3.0.  See <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/'>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/</a> for a brief explanation.  Note the no-derivs clause: if you wish to alter or expand the library, get in touch and we'll get you write perms to the repo.  I'd much rather you send feedback and patches to back to the central community, instead of fracturing improvements up into unmerged private versions.  (Using this library, extending its classes, and implementing its interfaces does not count as creating derivitive work as forbidden by the license.)

	The subversion repository lives at <a href='https://rubicon.exultant.us/svn/ahs/'>https://rubicon.exultant.us/svn/ahs/</a>.

<p>
	Documentation for new users is available <a href='intro'>here</a>.  (Also, this documentation is in the repository itself, so you can both read and contribute to it that way.)
