/**
 * Produces a stream where each line contains datapoints about system resource usage
 * metrics at a point in time.

 * "msUptime percentCpuUse mbHeapTotal mbHeapYoung mbHeapSurvivor mbHeapOld"
 * 
 * It is also possible to log the currently committed sizes of all heaps, but this class
 * doesn't do it. It is unfortunately NOT possible to get the percent usage per CPU core.
 * Things in megabytes are generally rounded up. Options for the naming of garbage
 * collector generations are not particularly well specified, so we take our best guess
 * there (and we ignore changes to the list of memory mx beans after initialization). We
 * could also log the number of collections run so far if we could consistently pick out
 * which of the two collectors was the "old" and the "young", but that again would be
 * making a lot of really dodgy assumptions and probably wouldn't be super useful anyway
 * so this class doesn't do it.
