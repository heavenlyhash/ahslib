/**
 * <p>
 * A WorkScheduler is a thread pooling and work organizing mechanism.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Every running JVM should aim to have exactly one WorkScheduler. A default singleton is
 * available from {@link WorkManager#getDefaultScheduler()}; use this whenever possible.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <div style="border:1px solid; margin:1em; padding:1em;">
 * <h3>Relationship between WorkScheduler, WorkTarget, and the Future</h3>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link WorkTarget} represents runnable logic that performs some work when given a
 * thread. A {@link WorkScheduler} provides threads to all of the WorkTargets that it
 * manages in the best order it knows how &mdash corraling tasks with clock-based
 * schedules and tasks of various priorities, all of which may or may not be ready to
 * perform some work at any given time. A WorkScheduler returns a {@link WorkFuture} when
 * given a WorkTarget to manage; this behaves pretty much exactly like you'd expect any
 * {@link Future} implementation to behave. WorkTargets and WorkFutures thusly should
 * stand in a one-to-one and onto relationship.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * It is only appropriate to schedule a single WorkTarget once and with a single
 * WorkScheduler at any one time. This condition is not checked in the code; it is up to
 * the developer to maintain sanity.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a WorkTarget represents a task which can be performed by several threads at once (a
 * common example being some sort of server can respond to one client independantly per
 * thread), then several instances of the same WorkTarget implementation should be created
 * and each of them scheduled &mdash one per thread which should be able to respond. (If
 * you want as many threads as possible to be able to perform a type of work, consider
 * creating a {@link Factory} for the WorkTarget and using the
 * {@link WorkManager#scheduleOnePerCore(Factory,WorkScheduler)} helper method.)
 * </p>
 * </div>

	 * </p>

	 * <p>
	 * You may schedule a task to have a scheduler periodically flush itself.
	 * {@link WorkManager#periodicallyFlush(WorkScheduler, long, TimeUnit)} is a
	 * one-line way to set this up.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Whether or not this method should actually be used is an interesting
	 * discussion.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * It is entirely possible to construct a program where all task completions and
	 * all work availability changes are updated in an event-based fashion, without
	 * resorting to polling {@link #flush()}. Polling {@link #flush()} periodically
	 * will provide less rapid reactions because there may be a delay proportional to
	 * the poll frequency for any new work; while high frequency polling may make this
	 * appear negligible to human standards, if events occur in a series the delay may
	 * apply at every stop in that series and accumulate to something serious.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * That being said, polling {@link #flush()} periodically is incredibly simple and
	 * very hard to screw up in a way that hangs you. Furthermore, in some systems
	 * that have very high throughputs of events and WorkTarget that are often ready,
	 * it's actually possible that designing to use periodic flushing instead of
	 * spending time doing dispatches of update requests for each event in a deluge
	 * can actually cause a net performance throughput win.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Note that in many implementations the scheduler may be forced to acquire a
	 * global lock on the entire scheduler in order to perform this function.

	//       - close and finish current - don't accept new tasks, but finish everything unless it requires clocked waiting (cancel those).
	//		one has to wonder a bit here as well... some clock tasks never expire.  loggers are typical of this.  should we have a wait-for-serious-tasks-but-ignore-the-stupid-ones mode somehow?  how on earth would you implement that or declare the stupidity of a task?
	//       - close and finish aggressively - threads should not pick up any new work when they finish their current.  everything in queues should be cancelled.
	//       - close and finish ragingly - interrupt all current tasks as well.
