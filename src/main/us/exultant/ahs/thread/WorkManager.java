Not the end of the world (especially if the entire application ignores the default one, since then those threads are never run anyway), but less than ideal.
	//	core problem 2: some programs might want to tweak performance settings -- changing the balance of thread allocation between priority bins, for example.  And those changes being global?  Urgh.
