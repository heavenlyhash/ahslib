/**
 * <p>
 * A latched work future is a very simple implementation of {@link WorkFuture} that just
 * exposes a {@link #set(Object)} method and becomes finished as soon as that's called;
 * it's comparable to {@link FutureTask}. It's mostly meant for use in constructing more
 * complex systems. Works great anywhere you might have wanted to use a
 * {@link CountDownLatch} but you also needed to support nonblocking callbacks as well as
 * blocking waiting; if you need to count down several times instead of just once, slip a
 * bunch of these {@link WorkFutureLatched} instances into a {@link WorkFutureAggregate}
 * and you win.
 * </p>
