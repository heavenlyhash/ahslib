/**
 * <p>
 * This class behaves almost exactly as per ConcurrentLinkedQueue (and is implemented
 * using it), but also provides additional semantics that allow one to determine at least
 * how many entries are in the queue as a constant time operation, and also provides a
 * blocking get functionality. This allows easy use as a work distributor, since one can
 * make get calls that will not return null simply because work is not instantaneously
 * available. Additionally, this class provides the ability to notify a {@link Listener}
 * whenever the pipe has a change in state nonblocking readers might wish to know of (i.e.
 * when it recieves new information, is closed, or becomes empty).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Requests that are blocking in nature are given fair ordering; nonblocking requests
 * disregard this entirely.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This Pipe will not accept nulls, and its WriteHead will throw a NullPointerException in
 * response to any attempt to write nulls.
 * </p>
