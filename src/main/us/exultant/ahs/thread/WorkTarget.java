/**

 * A WorkTarget is similar to {@link Runnable} and/or {@link Callable}, but combines the
 * concept of runnability with properties essential for intelligent scheduling of work.
 * Implementations of the WorkTarget interface which define their readiness for scheduling
 * based on availability of messages from a {@link us.exultant.ahs.core.ReadHead} form the
 * essence of the Actor model of concurrent programming.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One WorkTarget instance must be created for every thread that you wish to be able to
 * perform that type of task concurrently, and it never makes sense to submit the same
 * WorkTarget into more than one WorkScheduler.

 *                The type returned by {@link #call()}. (This can often be {@link Void} in
 *                the case of WorkTarget that are designed to be called repeatedly, since
 *                they tend to ferry data in and out via {@link ReadHead} and
 *                {@link WriteHead} instead of simply returning one piece of data.)

	 * The return value of this method is used by {@link WorkScheduler} to determine
	 * whether or not it is presently appropriate to consider scheduling this
	 * WorkTarget to be powered by a thread. {@link WorkScheduler} checks this method
	 * under one of two conditions: either when triggered (i.e. by a callback on a

	 * mechanism) or when polled (in which case this WorkTarget must have been
	 * specially registered with the WorkScheduler for polling-based readiness checks;
	 * this mechanism can be useful if work data is produced at such a high volume
	 * that the reduced synchronization is a performance improvement, but the
	 * event-based mechanism is generally preferred and will have better performance
	 * when the system is at rest).

	 * exactly true under all circumstances due to the concurrent nature of the
	 * question. For example, this WorkTarget may claim to be ready when asked by the
	 * WorkScheduler, but then may turn out to not find work when it's actually
	 * powered because some other WorkTarget has drained from the some Pipe that
	 * provides the flow of work input data to both WorkTarget.

	 * Calling this method after {@link #isDone()} returns true may have undefined

	 * efficiency. (In a practical sense, this interface cannot impose a strict limit
	 * on the actual time that will be consumed by this call; if for example the
	 * <code>WorkTarget</code> is assigned to some sort of blocking I/O channel, the
	 * call may wait indefinitely in the same fashion as the underlying channel.
	 * However, this sort of behavior should be avoided at all costs since

	 * WorkScheduler may use this priority to the best of its ability in scheduling
	 * work for powering by the scheduler's threads, but the priority at any point in
	 * time is at most a best-effort basis and not a guarantee of order due to the

	 * scheduled based on wall-clock time).

	 * This priority may change over time (this could be useful for example in a
	 * program which has several work buffers and always wishes to service the fullest
	 * one, or similar the least recently served one); WorkScheduler who obey the

	 * which is composed of three types of task: nonblocking reads, some application
	 * logic, and nonblocking writes of the result. By simply giving writes the
	 * highest priority, application logic a medium priority, and reads the lowest
	 * priority, the entire application becomes optimized to keep all of its pipes
	 * between these task as small as possible, and furthermore if the reads happen to
	 * be based on some system including a sliding window (namely, TCP), the TCP
	 * buffer naturally fills in the OS kernel layer and causes the TCP window to
	 * automatically adapt when the application level logic is over burdened &mdash;
	 * all with no special effort from the application designer except for setting
	 * those three priorities.
