/**
 * <p>
 * A WorkTarget is similar to {@link Runnable} and/or {@link Callable}, but combines the
 * concept of runnability with properties essential for intelligent scheduling of work.
 * Implementations of the WorkTarget interface which define their readiness for scheduling
 * based on availability of messages from a {@link us.exultant.ahs.core.ReadHead} form the
 * essence of the Actor model of concurrent programming.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * One WorkTarget instance must be created for every thread that you wish to be able to
 * perform that type of task concurrently, and it never makes sense to submit the same
 * WorkTarget into more than one WorkScheduler.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @author Eric Myhre <tt>hash@exultant.us</tt>
 * @param <$V>
 *                The type returned by {@link #call()}. (This can often be {@link Void} in
 *                the case of WorkTarget that are designed to be called repeatedly, since
 *                they tend to ferry data in and out via {@link ReadHead} and
 *                {@link WriteHead} instead of simply returning one piece of data.)

	 * <p>
	 * Defines whether or not this WorkTarget currently has enough data available to
	 * complete some atom of work immediately if powered.

	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The return value of this method is used by {@link WorkScheduler} to determine
	 * whether or not it is presently appropriate to consider scheduling this
	 * WorkTarget to be powered by a thread. {@link WorkScheduler} checks this method
	 * under two conditions: whenever it finishes a run of the work, and sometime
	 * after an update is requested via the {@link WorkScheduler#update(WorkFuture)}
	 * method. (Typically, updates are requested when triggered (i.e. by a callback on
	 * a {@link Pipe} that feeds work data for this target; this is the preferred
	 * mechanism); otherwise it may be done in polling fashion (this mechanism can be
	 * useful if work data is produced at such a high volume that the reduced
	 * synchronization is a performance improvement, but the event-based mechanism is
	 * generally preferred and will have better performance when the system is at
	 * rest. In either case it is necessary to make these arrangements after
	 * scheduling a WorkTarget, since the WorkFuture returned from the scheduling
	 * process is necessary.)
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The answer to this question is based on a best-effort system and may not be
	 * exactly true under all circumstances due to the concurrent nature of the
	 * question. For example, this WorkTarget may claim to be ready when asked by the
	 * WorkScheduler, but then may turn out to not find work when it's actually
	 * powered because some other WorkTarget has drained from the same Pipe that
	 * provides the flow of work input data to both WorkTarget.

	/**
	 * <p>
	 * Causes the current thread to be consumed in the running of the
	 * <code>WorkTarget</code>, similarly to the {@link Runnable#run()} method.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * This method can be called at any time, and any number of times, and need not be
	 * reentrant &mdash it is the responsibility of the caller to make sure that calls
	 * to this method are properly synchronized. (If a WorkTarget is scheduled with a
	 * {@link WorkScheduler}, this is handled automatically.)
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Each invocation of this method may return a value or throw an exception after
	 * performing its work, and this result may be different with every invocation.
	 * Typically this result is most convenient to use for tasks that are only run
	 * once; for tasks that may be run repeatedly, it is often more convenient to use
	 * a {@link Pipe.Sink} to gather output and set the generic return type to
	 * {@link Void}.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Calling this method after {@link #isDone()} returns true is allowed to have
	 * undefined results (i.e., may return any value, or null, or throw an exception),
	 * but it MUST return immediately. (When submitted to a {@link WorkScheduler}, the
	 * {@link WorkFuture#get()} method of the returned {@link WorkFuture} can be used
	 * to consistently access the final result of the work.)
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * It is typically expected that this method will be called by a thread from a
	 * pool kept within a {@link WorkScheduler}. As such, all actions taken by this
	 * method should not resort to waiting nor use blocking operations in order for a
	 * complete system of scheduled WorkTargets to work smoothly and with high
	 * efficiency. (In a practical sense, this interface cannot impose a strict limit
	 * on the actual time that will be consumed by this call; if for example the
	 * <code>WorkTarget</code> is assigned to some sort of blocking I/O channel, the
	 * call may wait indefinitely in the same fashion as the underlying channel.
	 * However, this sort of behavior should be avoided at all costs since
	 * {@link WorkScheduler} assigns threads based on the assumption that this sort of
	 * idiocy will not be performed.)
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <h3>Additional return constraints when using a {@link WorkScheduler}</h3>
	 * <p>
	 * WorkScheduler implementations and the WorkFuture they link to a WorkTarget make
	 * it possible to consistently access the "final" result of a WorkTarget that has
	 * become done. However, they also add a few special rules:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Exceptions thrown from this {@link #call()} method cause the WorkScheduler
	 * to stop handling this WorkTarget, and the WorkFuture will always thrown that
	 * exception (wrapped in an {@link ExecutionException}) from
	 * {@link WorkFuture#get()}.
	 * <li>Whenever this {@link #call()} method returns <tt>null</tt>, that return is
	 * ignored &mdash; if the WorkTarget becomes finished before any other invocations
	 * of <tt>call()</tt>, then the {@link WorkFuture#get()} method will return the
	 * most recent non-null return from the <tt>call()</tt> method. (It is still
	 * possible for {@link WorkFuture#get()} to return <tt>null</tt> if
	 * <tt>call()</tt> only ever returns null.)
	 * <li>{@link WorkFuture#get()} will throw a {@link CancellationException} if
	 * {@link WorkFuture#cancel(boolean)} was called before this WorkTarget became
	 * done (regardless of anything this <tt>call</tt> method has already returned).
	 * </ul>
	 * </p>

	 *

	 * Once this method returns true, it should never again return false. (In other

	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * WorkScheduler may use this priority to the best of its ability in scheduling
	 * work for powering by the scheduler's threads, but the priority at any point in
	 * time is at most a best-effort basis and not a guarantee of order due to the
	 * concurrent nature of the scheduling and furthermore because a WorkScheduler
	 * implementation may balance concerns other than priority (such as tasks
	 * scheduled based on wall-clock time).
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * This priority may change over time (this could be useful for example in a
	 * program which has several work buffers and always wishes to service the fullest
	 * one, or similarly the least recently served one); WorkScheduler who obey the
	 * priority hint will do their best to respond to this in a timely manner every

	 * invocation of the {@link WorkScheduler#update(WorkFuture)} method.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Another example of effective use of the priority system is a server application
	 * which is composed of three types of task: nonblocking reads, some application
	 * logic, and nonblocking writes of the result. By simply giving writes the
	 * highest priority, application logic a medium priority, and reads the lowest
	 * priority, the entire application becomes optimized to keep all of its pipes
	 * between these task as small as possible, and furthermore if the reads happen to
	 * be based on some system including a sliding window (namely, TCP), the TCP
	 * buffer naturally fills in the OS kernel layer and causes the TCP window to
	 * automatically adapt when the application level logic is over burdened &mdash;
	 * all with no special effort from the application designer except for setting
	 * those three priorities.
