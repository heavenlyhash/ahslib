/**
 * Given a set of {@link WorkFuture} entered into the {@link WriteHead} sink of this
 * {@link Flow}, the source {@link ReadHead} will return the same WorkFutures once they
 * are completed, and in the (approximate) order of completion.
 * 
 * Unfortunately, this could not be provided for Future as well as for WorkFuture, because
 * there is no ability to detect the completion of a Future in a nonblocking way without
 * resorting to polling (this of course was the entire reason for the WorkFuture interface
 * to begin with).

//this is obscenely similar to ExecutorCompletionService.
//note however that our semantics for close again come in handy here: 
//  there's a difference between a ExecutorCompletionService that returns null and a FuturePipe that's closed.
//    The ECS tends to require that you load all your Futures into the ECS before you start polling them for completion so you can tell for sure when you're actually done;
//    the FuturePipe supplies a thread-safe closing operation that deals with that problem and thus broadens the range of applications significantly.
//      in particular, think of a series of futures which can't all be loaded into a scheduler at once for some reason (maybe they can programmatically generate more of their own type, for example); a person can still use a FuturePipe to deal with this, whereas an ExecutorCompletionService may stumble quite seriously.
//perhaps most importantly, ECS is kinda ridiculous in that you can't use it to watch something for completion unless you schedule it with that very ECS.  that's EXTREMELY limiting, and implies splitting things into different thread pools depending on what kind of notifications you require out of them (which, hello, is completely contrary to the whole point of POOLS of threads), and just generally sucks.
