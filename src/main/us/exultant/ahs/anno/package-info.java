 * Annotations useful for conveying contracts &mdash; stuff that isn't checked by the java
 * compiler, but is useful to reason about and declare in a consistent way. Generally,
 * annotations such as these would be valid targets for other static code analysis tools.
 * Immutability is one example of a contract that can sometimes be difficult to enforce
 * programmatically, but is very useful to be able to adhere to contractually. Many terms
 * to help clarify the boundaries of concurrent code are also provided.
