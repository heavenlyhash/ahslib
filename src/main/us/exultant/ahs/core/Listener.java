/**
 * <p>
 * Generic interface for listeners (whether for events or messages).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>exceptions</h3>
 * <p>
 * <b>Listeners are strongly expected NOT to throw unchecked exceptions from their
 * {@link #hear(Object)} method!</b> Listeners can often be decoupled from the systems
 * that actually generate the reason for the listener to have been invoked (i.e. via pipes
 * or event busses, or they may be issued by concurrency control systems, etc), and so
 * throwing exceptions will rarely if ever actually be able to propagate out to a system
 * which could reasonably be considered responsible.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>usage patterns</h3>
 * <p>
 * If a class wishes to handle multiple different types of events, a good pattern for this
 * is for that class to contain a number of nested classes which each implements this
 * Listener interface. This practice allows messages of different types to be routed
 * through one object without name collisions or bad encapsulation breaks (or revealing
 * more functions than necessary on the base class).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>concurrency</h3>
 * <p>
 * Listeners may be presumed to be reentrant or otherwise <b>thread-safe</b> whenever
 * applied in the threading module of the AHS library! If a Listener cannot be safely
 * entered by multiple threads concurrently, the {@link #hear(Object)} method should be
 * synchronized and this departure from theme should be loudly documented due to the
 * potential for this synchronization to have a large performance impact.
 * </p>
