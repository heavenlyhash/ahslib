/**
 * <p>
 * Provides an interface to make file, network, and internal pipe operations all
 * transparent and operational in either blocking or nonblocking modes. This unified
 * scheme has the noteworthy aspect of always allowing incoming data to be requested at
 * the application's leisure (as opposed to requiring any sort of event listener), while
 * simultaneously allowing event listeners to be attached if the old "listener" pattern is
 * desired or "select"-like functionality need be implemented across multiple ReadHead
 * instances. ReadHead is the complement of {@link WriteHead}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Unlike other stream and channel interfaces, ReadHead intends to always be aligned to
 * something <i>meaningful</i> &mdash; though what exactly constitutes "meaningful" is
 * left up to the implementation, and is specified by the generic type. ReadHead
 * specifically intends to prevent any excessive copying of arrays around by its clients;
 * a single instance of the generic object returned by the read methods should be
 * sufficient to warrant processing in its own right, and the readAll methods are provided
 * only as a matter of completeness and convenience (and because many stream and channel
 * interfaces lack such simple conveniences) for use when the total volume of data is
 * manageably small. Thus, a binary transport with a ReadHead interface would typically be
 * designed to return ByteBuffer representing an entire frame of data.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementers of this interface could potentially be used to decorate an instance
 * {@link java.io.InputStream}, {@link java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue},
 * {@link java.nio.channels.Channel}... whatever. Most typically, communication between
 * threads in a single VM is handled by using a {@link us.exultant.ahs.thread.Pipe}, which
 * provides highly efficient synchronized message passing with ReadHead and WriteHead
 * interfaces. Communication across sockets or to the filesystem is provided ready-made by
 * ReadHead implementations in the {@link us.exultant.ahs.io} package.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementers are typically expected to follow some sort of RAII (Resource Acquisition
 * Is Initialization) pattern, as no methods regarding opening or initializing are
 * provided by this interface, but there is absolutely no requirement that implementers do
 * so, and methods responsible for initialization may be as apt.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Implementers should avoid throwing OperationNotSupported exceptions from methods
 * relating to nonblocking reads if at all possible even when the underlying stream or
 * channel is provides only blocking services. Such issues can be resolved by reading the
 * blocking stream into a nonblocking buffer using an external thread, then providing
 * direct access only to the nonblocking buffer. (The {@link us.exultant.ahs.thread.Pipe}
 * class in the {@link us.exultant.ahs.thread} module of AHSlib is an ideal helper for
 * such a role.)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that the lack of methods for reading contiguous blocks; this is neither accidental
 * nor an oversight. The author asserts that if you find yourself with a desire for this
 * behavior, you're Doing It Wrong. The problem you are confronting is probably best
 * solved by using a ReadHead with a generic type that it itself a generic List, or using
 * some other sort of object as a container for batches.

public interface ReadHead<$T> {
	/**
	 * <p>
	 * Sets a {@link Listener} for critical events in the life cycle of the ReadHead.
	 * The Listener must be invoked by the implementer every time a new chunk of data
	 * becomes available. Implementations may also choose to use it to signal other
	 * critical events such as the closing of the underlying stream, or the drain of
	 * the final piece of data from an already-closed stream. In all situations, the
	 * Listener is handed a reference to this ReadHead.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Despite the listener's intended purpose, it is critical to note that even if a
	 * {@link #hasNext()} call is the first thing within the Listener's
	 * {@link Listener#hear(Object) hear(ReadHead<$T>)} procedure, that call may
	 * return false. This may situation may arise even if the call to the Listener was
	 * intended to signal new data availability, since multithreaded access to the
	 * ReadHead can result in another thread having pre-empted the Listener and
	 * consumed the data before the Listener can respond.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The Listener's {@link Listener#hear(Object) hear(ReadHead<$T>)} method will be
	 * invoked from the thread that caused the state change, and as such must not be
	 * responsible for any intensive or time-consuming operations, nor is it allowed
	 * to block. The recommended usage is to simply provide an event listener that
	 * marks the ReadHead as (probably) having data available in some other
	 * "selector"-like scheme. (If you're unfamiliar with
	 * {@link us.exultant.ahs.thread.WorkTarget} and
	 * {@link us.exultant.ahs.thread.WorkScheduler} tools, consider reading up on
	 * those; you may find them extremely useful because they're able to deal with
	 * such concepts of readiness very powerfully and efficiently).
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Implementers typically call the listener's {@link Listener#hear(Object)} method
	 * once per semantic event &mdash however, this is not required, and if multiple
	 * new chunks become available in a batch, then it is allowed for the implementer
	 * to only invoke the listener one time after the entire batch is loaded in order
	 * to reduce noise. Therefore, users of events from ReadHead are advised to use
	 * {@link #readAllNow()} instead of just {@link #readNow()} (or use
	 * {@link #readNow()} in a loop until it returns null, which may provide better
	 * load balancing between reading threads if applicable) in response to hearing an
	 * update. (Again, consider applying a {@link us.exultant.ahs.thread.WorkTarget}
	 * here: implementing a {@link us.exultant.ahs.thread.WorkTarget#call()} method
	 * that uses {@link #readNow()} in a WorkTarget and defines
	 * {@link us.exultant.ahs.thread.WorkTarget#isReady()} by {@link #hasNext()} is a
	 * useful idiom.)
