/**
 * <p>
 * This class provides a comprehensive wrapper (more of an asylum, really) around
 * {@link Selector java.nio.channels.Selector} that simplifies common operation and
 * provides efficient, thread-safe controls that the java Selector fails to provide. Using
 * this class, it becomes possible to register and deregister selectable channels from any
 * thread at any time safely, and the entire system conforms to the {@link WorkTarget}
 * system so it can work in the same pools and with the same tools as any systems based on
 * the AHSlib threading module.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There is a default global singleton instance of this available from
 * {@link IOManager#getDefaultSelectionSignaller()} that should be used in almost every
 * situation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you choose not to use the default global instance of this selector and instead
 * construct and schedule your own, please note that this WorkTarget is not so ammenable
 * to pooling as one might like; unfortunately, there were design choices made in the core
 * of the Java standard libraries that leave us with a lot of limitations. In particular,
 * we have no way of getting events that the selector itself has events ready other than
 * full-out checking it &mdash; so, we're stuck with an {@link Worker#isReady()} method
 * that helplessly always returns true, and fundamentally no way to disbatch events
 * relating to the core selector's readiness. There are two ways to deal with this: you
 * may actually just run this system in its own personal thread (creating a
 * {@link WorkSchedulerFlexiblePriority} instance with a thread pool of size one is a
 * reasonable way to do this); otherwise, if you do wish to keep it in the same Scheduler
 * as other tasks, you should be sure to construct this selector with purely nonblocking
 * mode (negative selection timeout parameter) and fixed-delay scheduling parameters (i.e.
 * {@link ScheduleParams#makeFixedDelay(long)}).
 * </p>
