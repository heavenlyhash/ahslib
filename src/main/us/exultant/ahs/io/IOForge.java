/**
 * <p>
 * IOForge largely just contains ghastly huge batches of convenience methods making
 * facades around java.io &mdash; getting rid of the dead-simple boilerplate code that
 * otherwise often shows up in numerous places in any sizable project. In particular,
 * these methods are oriented around the following axioms:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Fuctions don't do anything piecemeal, they just give you the answer you wanted and
 * don't make you worry about it.
 * <li>For local filesystem operations.
 * <li>Zero threading, nonblocking, or anything interesting &mdash just dead-simple stuff.
 * <li>Includes all the little edge cases that often throw a novice coder, such as closing
 * streams even if their creation threw exceptions (which if neglected can deplete the
 * range of file descriptors the OS is willing to allocate), etc.
 * <li>Charset always defaults to UTF-8 (instead of the "platform default").
 * <li>Operations are always sensibly buffered.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If you're looking for higher-powered APIs that do network stuff or high-performance
 * nonblocking operations, you'll want to look elsewhere in the IO package. These
 * functions are mostly just intended to be great for rapid application development or use
 * by Java novices.
 * </p>
