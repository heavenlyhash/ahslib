/**
 * <p>
 * This class provides a comprehensive wrapper (more of an asylum, really) around
 * {@link Selector java.nio.channels.Selector} that simplifies common operation and
 * provides efficient, thread-safe controls that the java Selector fails to provide. Using
 * this class, it becomes possible to register and deregister selectable channels from any
 * thread at any time safely, and the entire system conforms to the {@link WorkTarget}
 * system so it can work in the same pools and with the same tools as any systems based on
 * the AHSlib threading module.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that this WorkTarget is not so ammenable to pooling as one might like;
 * unfortunately, there were design choices made in the core of the Java standard
 * libraries that leave us with a lot of limitations. In particular, we have no way of
 * getting events that the selector itself has events ready other than full-out checking
 * it &mdash; so, we're stuck with an {@link #isReady()} method that helplessly always
 * returns true, and fundamentally no way to disbatch events relating to the core
 * selector's readiness. So, all in all, you may still actually need to just run this
 * system in its own personal thread &mdash creating a
 * {@link WorkSchedulerFlexiblePriority} instance with a thread pool of size one is a
 * reasonable way to do this..
 * </p>
