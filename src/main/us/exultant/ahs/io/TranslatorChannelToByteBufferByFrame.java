/**
 * <p>
 * This 'reads' by actually 'translating' bytes off of a communication channel. It follows
 * the dead-simple "babble" protocol: the bytes should look like a series of 4-byte signed
 * integer lengths, followed by an arbitrary blob of the size specified by the int. The
 * size bytes are discarded after being used to determine the blob, and the blob is
 * wrapped in a ByteBuffer and returned as the result of the translation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The concrete implementation of this is provided as a nested class in order to match the
 * organization of the closely related {@link TranslatorByteBufferToChannelByFrame} class; at
 * present there is only one such implementation ({@link Nonblocking}). It is presumed
 * that the base channel has already been set to a nonblocking mode.
