/**
 * <p>
 * Buffers a 2-D character array with graphical attributes (i.e. a {@link Palette}).
 * Typically, one of these with a single backing array is produced for every draw to be
 * rendered on the terminal, then various other Window objects as "views" to the first are
 * spawned for each component to be drawn, always with a clip assigned to it so that
 * components cannot draw outside of their allocated area.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A window clipped to 2,1,6,4 will be able to draw on the starred area:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  012345678
 * 0.........
 * 1..******.
 * 2..******.
 * 3..******.
 * 4..******.
 * 5.........
 * 6.........
 * 7.........
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Placing a character in relative position 3,1 after the clip will place the character in
 * 5,2 globally. The farthest to the bottom-left that it is legal to place a character
 * with this clip is 5,3 (global 7,4).
 * </p>
