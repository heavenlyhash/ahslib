// ENT stands for ENqueued Task, or possibly just ENTry.  Or Existing isN't Tolerable?

ENT:DONE!: update arrangement of libraries within svn and workspace.
	- DONE: require separate codebases (i.e. source folders in eclipse parlance) within the ahs.* tree.
		- DONE: test cases in particular become more organized when they can exist in a separate directory structure but parallel package.
	- DONE: projects should be able to check in extremely local symlinks in their source setup (i.e. "../?") which anyone can conveniently arrange their workspace to accomodate by simply checking out the the relevant library source into the up-one directory, or using more complicated symlinks in that up-one directory as befits their personal local configuration.
		- if anyone complains about the machine time wasted resolving symlinks (possibly recursively) just to get library code, those individuals should be informed that they are Doing It Wrong -- if that kind of dire efficiency is needed, you should be working with compiled jar files already anyway, and those can contain the entire relevant library code.
		- if anyone complains about the fragility of checking in symlinks as part of core code, those individuals should be informed that they are Doing It Wrong -- as long as every symlink points to a consistent relative location just outside the project space, everything is easy -- no matter what your personal organizational preferences, you can daisy-chain symlinks together outside of the shared version-controlled area to acheive whatever effect you desire.
		- if anyone complains about the danger of symlinking an entire library, especially one that's undergoing active modification... well, that's almost sane.
			- but still Doing It Wrong, because any included libraries should be under version control as well, and any sane version control system supports getting revisions by date... thus, it's trivial to check out sets of things from a single date; at worst you've hit one of the small windows where one repo is updated and another is pending, in which case you can just try again with a date a few seconds in the future.
			- but still Doing It Wrong, because remember how you can daisy chain symlinks to do whatever you want?  You can use that to point to the checkout of a specific revision of the library if you have that need (and subversion will note as much if you do the version-numbered link within your project).
		- also, see points about the benefits of all this on the below item.
	- DONE: even when dealing with an external library that we wish to view as essentially static, jars (especially compiled ones containing only .class files) should not be used.  The entire source should be placed handily within the workspace and symlinked into every relevant project (just like everything else, i.e. libraries we're actively developing such as the ahs).
		- this makes consulting the source easier (including eclipse's autogeneration of docs on the fly with zero configuration).
		- this allows compilation of any "final product" jars to compile their own .class files for only those classes needed, minimizing jar size and avoiding the clusterfuck of nested jars (and eliding the alternate option of needing multiple jars to constitute a workable program).
			- this is highly significant in applet production, since the first load time can be a huge impression on usability.

ENT:DONE! upgrade ahs.io.codec.* interfaces to fully support a "hint"able system for decoding.

ENT: unify a helper library for applying bouncy castle crypto.
	- draw this from the experimental pool in the secserv project when it reaches greater maturity.

ENT: revisit existing methods for building JSONObject and JSONArray instances from strings.
	- Inline comments must be handled correctly (since we will always want this to comprise our configuration file format, and thus be extremely human-friendly).
		- there are some questions here about writing config back again.  i don't think i've ever intended to bother remembering where comments are -- how would you do that correctly, in general?

ENT: add YAML support to Eon (at least some of it, on the reading side... YAML overall is insane.)

ENT: complete the new *[Read/Write]Head systems for dealing with "big" IO and standardized chunking of streams.
	- DONE: ReadHead and implementers for blocking streams
	- DONE: in-program pipes, genericly
	- DONE: need implementers for NIO channel stuff
	- DONE: need translator-like implementers that are going to get you from babble to eon objects ready to be fed to codecs
	- need to give a little more consideration to the local filesystem.
		- in particular, it's a little odd that we have translator stacks for going straight onto the network but nothing comparable for the local filesystem (and that's not saying i think it's necessary for the local filesystem, mind you).
	- buffering WriteHead
	- consider layers for byte counting?  prolly more of a translator thing.	

ENT: lay out a simple set of convenience functions for more "transaction"-like file system interaction.
	- We're not aiming for anything like a full versioned filesystem or even necessarily guarantees of atomicity on a greater than one file scale; just jumping around so that if a write fails to complete, the old file is still somewhere handy and so is the partial write.
	- This is actually easier said than done in some common POSIX situations (unless you're root, obviously, but that would be dire, dire overkill for daily usage).
		- impossible if owner must be maintained and isn't the process owner
		- impossible if group must be maintained and isn't a group the process owner belongs to
		- impossible if directory doesn't allow (new) writes from the process owner

ENT: consider an eventual name change for the entire ahs library.
	- It's displeasing to be associated with the American Horticultural Society, the Animal Humane Society, or the The Vertical Flight Society (which is obviously composed of people who can't spell).
	- Albany High School, The American Headache SocietyÂ®, The American Hemerocallis Society (...that sounds like a horrible disease, not a flower), the American Hanoverian Society, American Home Shield, and Alberta Health Services are all also distasteful.
	- It's also pretty much unpronouncable (obviously), and it's impossible to get a three letter domain name.

ENT: consider a generic Map implementation that enforces a bound on Map<Thing1<?>, Thing2<?>> so that the wildcard classes for each entry must align at runtime.
	- This is something that's been showing up a lot inside the implementations of generic Codec stuff.
